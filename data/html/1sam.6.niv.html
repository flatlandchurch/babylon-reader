         <div class="p"><span class="content">  </span><span class="verse v1" data-usfm="1SA.6.1"><span class="label">1</span><span class="content">When the ark of the </span><span class="nd"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> had been in Philistine territory seven months, </span></span><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="1SA.6.2"><span class="label">2</span><span class="content">the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the </span><span class="nd"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content">? Tell us how we should send it back to its place.”</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v2" data-usfm="1SA.6.2"><span class="content">  </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="1SA.6.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content">They answered, “If you return the ark of the god of Israel, do not send it back to him without a gift; by all means send a guilt offering to him. Then you will be healed, and you will know why his hand has not been lifted from you.”</span></span></div>

         <div class="p"><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="1SA.6.4"><span class="content">They replied, “Five gold tumors and five gold rats, according to the number of the Philistine rulers, because the same plague has struck both you and your rulers. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="1SA.6.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content">Make models of the tumors and of the rats that are destroying the country, and give glory to Israel’s god. Perhaps he will lift his hand from you and your gods and your land. </span></span><span class="verse v6" data-usfm="1SA.6.6"><span class="label">6</span><span class="content">Why do you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh did? When Israel’s god dealt harshly with them, did they not send the Israelites out so they could go on their way?</span></span></div>

Hitch the cows to the cart, but take their calves away and pen them up. </span></span><span class="verse v8" data-usfm="1SA.6.8"><span class="label">8</span><span class="content">Take the ark of the </span><span class="nd"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> and put it on the cart, and in a chest beside it put the gold objects you are sending back to him as a guilt offering. Send it on its way, </span></span><span class="verse v9" data-usfm="1SA.6.9"><span class="label">9</span><span class="content">but keep watching it. If it goes up to its own territory, toward Beth Shemesh, then the </span><span class="nd"><span class="content">Lord</span></span><span class="content"> has brought this great disaster on us. But if it does not, then we will know that it was not his hand that struck us but that it happened to us by chance.”</span></span></div>
