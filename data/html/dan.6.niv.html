The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss. </span></span><span class="verse v3" data-usfm="DAN.6.3"><span class="label">3</span><span class="content">Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. </span></span><span class="verse v4" data-usfm="DAN.6.4"><span class="label">4</span><span class="content">At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent. </span></span><span class="verse v5" data-usfm="DAN.6.5"><span class="label">5</span><span class="content">Finally these men said, “We will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God.”</span></span></div>

Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before. </span></span><span class="verse v11" data-usfm="DAN.6.11"><span class="label">11</span><span class="content">Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help. </span></span><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="DAN.6.12"><span class="label">12</span><span class="content">So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: “Did you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human being except to you, Your Majesty, would be thrown into the lions’ den?”</span></span></div>
         <div class="p"><span class="verse v12" data-usfm="DAN.6.12"><span class="content">The king answered, “The decree stands—in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.”</span></span></div>

He still prays three times a day.” </span></span><span class="verse v14" data-usfm="DAN.6.14"><span class="label">14</span><span class="content">When the king heard this, he was greatly distressed; he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him.</span></span></div>
