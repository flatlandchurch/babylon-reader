<p>Well, I messed up.</p>
<p>If you tried to read today's Babylon Reader reading (Genesis 1-4), it's quite likely that when you "marked complete" nothing happened.</p>
<p>This was a bug, and we've resolved it. But we didn't want you to have to remember to go in and mark complete, especially since there's a special, secret badge that you'll receive if you read every day's reading <em>on the day</em>.</p>
<p>So, unless you'd read in the last hour or two, I went ahead and marked your <strong>Day 1 reading</strong> as complete. (This means that if you haven't read it yet, you should probably get on it, ya know, to stay honest ðŸ˜‰). Now the next time you login to <a href="https://babylon.flatland.church">the reader</a> you'll receive a badge for reading day 1.</p>
<p><br />Excited to keep reading with you!</p>
