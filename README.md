## Attribution

I am indebted to two individuals without whose code I would not have been able to build this:

- [Randall Mason](https://github.com/ClashTheBunny) - My yves parser is merely a JS implementation of [his own Python version](https://github.com/ClashTheBunny/calibre-yves-input)
- [Josh Duff](https://github.com/TehShrike) - Josh's work on the [word-english-bible](https://github.com/TehShrike/world-english-bible) HTML parser was the starting-point for my own. Further, I entirely forked (with a few minor stylistic changes) his data finalizer

Attribution is acknowledged both here and above the code where appropriate, further, as the yves parser is licensed as GPL 3, it seemed only right to do the same here.

## Usage
