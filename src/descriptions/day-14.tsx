      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        Yesterday we surveyed the twisty story of Solomon. A king who followed in the ways of his
        father and built YHWH a magnificent temple. Yet he forced the people of Israel into labour,
        he accumulated wealth, he purchased chariots from Egypt, and even made alliances through
        marriage to foreign women.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solomon's story is perplexing as we are given a clear example of someone who has chosen to
        receive God's wisdom, but often acts quite contrary to it. Solomon's decisions, luxury, and
        forced labour leads to the division of the nation of Israel. It is the end of an era, and
        we're left with a far more hollow feeling than we did at the death of David.
