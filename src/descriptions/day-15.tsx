      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        The hope and design of the promised land was that all could enjoy the blessings of God's
        gift. For some, that would be new homes, or a freshly planted vineyard. For others, it would
        be the joys of marriage and family. All of this was designed to be enjoyed within the land,
        and the enjoyment of these blessings was seen as more important than national security or
        economic growth. (You'll read more about this tomorrow).
      </p>
      <p>
        We remember from our reading of Deuteronomy 28 that the consequence of forgetting God and
        chasing after idols, wealth, and empire would lead to exile from the good land God had given
        Israel.
      </p>
      <p>
        We begin today's reading with a short aside of one of Israel's kings robbing a man of the
        goodness of the land and how God responds to such an act. We conclude with the final, tragic
        decent of Israel into exile under the Babylonians.
