      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        God institutes a covenant with the people of Israel from Mount Sinai, which we read the
        opening words of yesterday. The covenant is focused primarily on God being the ruler of the
        Israelite nation, with priests, prophets, and kings as representatives of his rulership and
        with the nation of Israel serving as representatives of God to the nations.
      </p>
      <p>
        But in addition, God is outlining how the people of Israel are meant to be a new kind of
        people. A nation that isn't anything like Babylon or Egypt. In Leviticus 16 we see God
        addressing the problem of sin, not through vengeance, but through atoning sacrifice through
        an animal. In Leviticus 23, he outlines a number of festivals in which the people remember
        that they belong to God and they rest in the goodness of the land God gives them.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Deuteronomy 17, God outlines what type of king Israel should have. This sort of king must
        not acquire much gold and silver, nor accumulate horses (especially when those horses come
        from Egypt). And he mustn't accumulate many wives lest they lead him into idolatry. This is
        filled with hyperlinks forward, so pay attention to the description of the king here,
        because you'll need it later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, Deuteronomy 28 prepares the people of Israel for what breaking their side of the
        agreement with God will look like: exile.
