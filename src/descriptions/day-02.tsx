      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        As we observed yesterday, Adam, Eve, and their son, Cain, when put to the test failed to
        live by God's definition of right and wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        The failure of Adam and Eve's family is perpetuated outwards through to the entire human
        family, leading to war, destruction, and ultimately: chaos in the vast wilderness of the
        ancient near east. At the start of Genesis 10, we find ourselves in much the same place we
        did at the beginning of Genesis 2: in the chaos wilderness hoping for God to bring order.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time it is humans who try to build order through the city of Babylon. Nimrod, a mighty
        hunter, creates a great city, laying the foundation for an evil empire that will spread out
        across the whole ancient near east. In an attempt to bring order to chaos, humans subjugate
        fellow Image Bearers and exalt just a handful of themselves as gods. The great tragedy is
        that God had created all humans to be his representatives, but now humans create gods out of
        stone in the shapes of animals and birds, choosing to worship a few instead of working as
        one human family.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, God confuses this false order by confusing the languages of all the people. But
        this merely divides the people of the land, it doesn't crush Babylon. Babylon still stands
        when we and Abram leave her in Genesis 12.
