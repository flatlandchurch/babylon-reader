      <p>
        A simple ending for week 3, Daniel 12 introduces us to the idea of the coming Resurrection
        of the body and the life everlasting. This idea would become crucial to the way the people
        of Jesus' day (and of course Jesus himself and his followers) would think about the end of
        the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming on the heels of Daniel 10-11, Daniel 12 is a helpful reminder that Babylon will
        eventually sow its own undoing and even the violence and evil that it unleashed will be
        undone through the power of the Resurrection.
