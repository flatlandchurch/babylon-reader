        We're going back to Deuteronomy, because there's something important we need to see there.
        In Deuteronomy 20, we see a list of people exempted from participating in war. God says that
        if you have recently become betrothed you must not go to war, rather, they should marry. And
        if you've just bought a house, you must not go to war, rather, enjoy your new home. And if
        you planted a vineyard, you should wait until you can enjoy the fruits of the vineyard
        before going to war.

        What does that have to do with exile? Well just before the exile, the big event we read
        about yesterday in 2 Kings 25, there were two streams of thought among Israel's prophets.
        One side, led by Hananiah, believed that Israel needed to take up arms and overthrow the
        Babylonian oppressors (Jeremiah 28). But the other side, which we learn was the side God was
        on the whole time, believed that the people of Israel needed to seek the peace of Babylon.

        Jeremiah, the prophet delivering this message, used an interesting phrase to describe this
        peace: plant vineyards, build houses, and get married. This is a direct hyperlink back to
        Deuteronomy 20. Jeremiah uses the language of rest and exemption from war to call all of
        God's people to peace over violent resistance.
