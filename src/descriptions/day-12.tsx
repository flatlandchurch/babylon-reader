      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        In Babylon, gods are seldom relational, loving, and faithful. Typically, they are tools of a
        select group of priests and kings to bend the will of the people to that of the ruling
        class. Much could be said about the worldview of the Israelite people, an even the writers
        of the Bible, as to whether these were actual spiritual beings behind the totems and statues
        or whether even at the time they assumed their non-existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the reality is, YHWH was not like the gods of Babylon, Egypt, or Canaan. YHWH could not
        be contained, and certainly would not have an image made of him â€“ since he had already made
        images in Genesis 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today we'll see the Israelite people, so influenced by the religions and practices of Canaan
        and Babylon, trying to carry God out onto the battle field like a totem. They think that if
        they just bring the ark with them, they will have victory. But God is not bound by objects
        of human hands, even those he ordained.
