      <p>
        The Book of Mark is the most concise of the four Gospel accounts. It has a pretty simple
        aim, to demonstrate that Jesus is the Son of God. While each of the Gospel accounts are
        filled with hyperlinks, Mark moves from beginning to end with little reflection or side
        paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        In today's reading alone, we'll see references to the Genesis 1, Exodus, the Day of
        Atonement, and Daniel 7. We'll begin to see the culmination of the readings of the last
        three weeks come to a head this week as the hyperlinks are layered one after another to
        demonstrate the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus.
