      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        The story of Scripture begins in formless chaos. In quick repetition we find ourselves
        immersed primordial chaos waters (Genesis 1) and then surrounded by the wild waste that is
        the desert wilderness (Genesis 2). Out of both God brings order, beauty, and life. And at
        the center of it all, a garden.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two caretakers are created, Adam and Eve. The pair are created to share in mutual care of
        one another and their garden paradise. They serve as vice-regents, co-ruling creation with
        God. All God asks is that they rule under his definition of right and wrong. He places
        before them two choices, life and death.
      </p>
      <p>
        God does this quite literally, placing a Tree of Life and a Tree of the Knowledge of Good
        and Evil in the center of the garden. One is an invitation for the human couple to partake
        in eternal, life-giving abundance. The other will lead the pair down a path of ruin and
        destruction. So what will they choose when put to this test?
