      <p>
        The way of Babylon is often marked by abuse of authority, exploitation, the diminishing of a
        fellow image bearer, and attempting to work out God's plan by our own will. At the close of
        yesterday's reading, we saw Abram and Sarai act like Babylon when they abused their nameless
        slave girl who they simply called <em>the foreigner</em> and try to bring about God's
        blessing through their own devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, we see that God's response to Babylon on earth is often creative and still so focused
        on restoration and the continuation of the project of evil. The very tool Abram used to
        dominate is now changed to be the symbol of the covenant in circumcision.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the conclusion of our reading, we will see God's judgement on an evil city who looks a
        lot like Cain and Lamech. Yet God invites Abram to intercede on behalf of this Babylon-like
        city.
