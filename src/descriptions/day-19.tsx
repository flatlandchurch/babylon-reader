        This is perhaps easily the most spectacular chapter in Daniel, if not in much of the Hebrew
        Bible. It is certainly among the chapters most hyperlinked to by the New Testament. Not only
        that, we see hyperlinks in this chapter which link back to many of the readings over the
        last 18 days.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that is why there is only one chapter today. Take some time to read and re-read today's
        chapter. Think about the connections to Genesis 1-11, Exodus 3, Deuteronomy 17, and Daniel
        2-4.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pay attention to the imagery surrounding each of the __beasts__, and see if you can think of
        other passages outside of our readings which verses 9 and 10 might be hyperlinking to.
