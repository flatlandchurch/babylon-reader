      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        In yesterday's reading, Jeremiah told the people of Israel on their way to exile to seek the
        prosperity of the city in which they dwelled. Daniel and his friends find themselves in the
        heart of the Babylonian empire and they are constantly faced with what seems like only two
        ways: be a peacemaker and conform to Babylonian customs, worship, and practice, or resist
        Babylon through vocal uprising, mockery, and violence.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Daniel and his friends discover a middle way. A way that is characterized by radical
        faithfulness to God and his instruction, but that is also peaceable and seeks the good of
        neighbor. Like we will eventually see with Jesus, this middle way often comes at great
        personal sacrifice. Daniel and his friends risk status, well-being, and even their lives in
        order to exercise peaceful, subversive resistance.
