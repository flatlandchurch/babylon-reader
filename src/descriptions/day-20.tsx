      <p>
        Daniel 9 contains a prayer which is so deeply saturated in the rest of the Hebrew Bible (and
        coincidentally, to our readings over the last three weeks). Daniel realizes, having read the
        letter of Jeremiah (Jeremiah 29), the exile must soon be over. Take time and think about the
        readings you've already done this series and notice how they are brought up in prayer by
        Daniel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Daniel 10 and 11 set up an end of the world, global-scale conflict which will ultimately be
        paid off in the Book of Revelation. Much of the imagery in these two chapters will be
        important later, so take inventory of the language used throughout.
