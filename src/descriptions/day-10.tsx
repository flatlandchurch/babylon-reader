      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        Judges 1 and 2 paint a stark picture of the trajectory of Israel. While things begin
        positively with great military victory, things begin to spiral out of control. While the
        Israelites were meant to completely drive out the Canaanites from their lands, many of the
        tribes allowed to live the foreign nations remain, mixing with them, taking on their customs
        and their gods.
      </p>
      <p>
        But as we remember from yesterday in Deuteronomy 28, God expected covenant faithfulness from
        the Israelites. The consequence would be the incursion of foreign military powers, and
        eventually, exile. Most of the book of Judges tracks the downward descent of Israel from the
        victories of Joshua to a nation which is indistinguishable – if not entirely worse – than
        the Canaanite nations around them.

        Judges 17 begins a truly gut-wrenching tale of a family trying to define good and evil for
        themselves (a hyperlink back to Genesis 3), creating an idol from personal wealth (a
        hyperlink back to Exodus 32), and distorting the holiness and singularity of the Tabernacle
        worship and practices.
