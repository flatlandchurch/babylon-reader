      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        Today's stories are among the most popular in the book of Daniel. Once again, we see the
        faithfulness of God's people is met with divine protection. We also read a very interesting
        tale about a king who is given authority and __dominion__ over all the world. But he also
        became proud. A Babylonian king who had grown proud of his own achievements, having made a
        name for himself. Now that sounds familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
        God's response is to curse the king to be like a beast, driven out to the fields until he
        can acknowledge God's greatness. Once again we see the inversion of rulership established in
        Genesis 1, as a human becomes like the beasts they were meant to rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you read chapter 6, ponder how it connects to other stories you've read so far. And think
        about the relationship of the faithful person of God and the beasts.
