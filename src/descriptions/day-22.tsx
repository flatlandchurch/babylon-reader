      <h2>Intro</h2>

        When Daniel read the scroll of Jeremiah, he realized that the time of the exile was well
        past due. When he questioned the angel about this time table, the angel revealed that even
        upon returning home, the people of Israel would still experience something of a spiritual
        exile.

        When the Hebrew Bible ends, Cyrus has just allowed the Jews to return to Judah and
        reestablish their lives, kingdom, and Temple. Over the next nearly 5 centuries, the people
        of Israel experienced the constant cycle of empire. Every time a new empire would rise to
        world-wide dominance, another would come up from beneath it, crush it, and start the cycle
        again.
      </p>

        Meanwhile, the Jewish people experienced profound spiritual renewal, seeking a new way to
        follow God focused on covenant faithfulness and avoiding a return to exile.

        Yet just as in the days of old, the kings of Israel often become more like Pharaoh than the
        prophet-priest-kings of Deuteronomy 17. And just like Pharaoh went after all the baby boys
        in Exodus 1, King Herod seeks the lives of the baby boys in Matthew 2. But in both cases,
        God's chosen deliverer is saved through the nation of Egypt.
