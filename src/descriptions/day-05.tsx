        The promise God made with Abraham (formerly Abram) was that through his family would come a
        blessing to the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the story of Joseph we see that blessing extend to Egypt and much of the ancient
        near east. But mixed within this blessing, we still observe some hints of the ways of
        Babylon, ways which though instituted by Joseph, will eventually come to harm the
        Israelites.

        Nevertheless, the story of Genesis concludes with the blessing of Abraham being passed
        forward to all the sons of Jacob who will soon become the 12 Tribes of Israel. The blessing
        poem is remarkable and has hyperlinks backwards to the stories of Genesis, as well as
        forward to the coming of the Messiah.
