      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        Yesterday, we read about God stretching out his might hand to strike Egypt and Pharaoh for
        their collective oppression and violence against the Hebrew people. Pharaoh operates in a
        world of scarcity where he must threaten the lives and livelihoods of those around him in
        order to feel as though he has abundance. So God responds in kind, striking the so-called
        abundance of Pharaoh which comes at the expense of the innocent.
      </p>
      <p>
        God turns Pharaoh's neatly ordered, myopic kingdom into chaos, just like he did to Babylon
        when he made their languages chaotic after they tried to make a name for themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        These final chapters of the rescue story which begins Exodus are climactic and excited, with
        God demonstrating his fully-orbed power over the cosmos. We conclude our readings from
        Exodus with chapter 20, in which God sets up the covenant with Israel entirely on the basis
        of his rescue of them.
