      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        The first blessing God gave humanity was to be fruitful and multiply. Then he blessed
        Abraham and made a covenant with him, saying that he would become a great nation and that
        his offspring would be come so numerous you could hardly count them.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the start of Exodus 1, we see the blessing of God manifest in the people of Israel. They
        were <em>exceedingly</em> fruitful and multiplied. But the king of Egypt saw this not as a
        blessing, but as a threat. The way of Babylon is one characterized by scarcity. The king of
        Egypt fears that the Israelites might become rebels because they outnumber the Egyptians, so
        they enslave them and oppress them with heavy labor and with violence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The culture of Egyptian slavery is one in which every day is filled with wearisome labor and
        heavy burdens. And even when begged to allow the people to rest for just three days, the
        king declares that the people are lazy and must be worked harder.
      </p>
      <p>
        But YHWH hears the cries of his people Egypt, just as he heard the cries of Abel's blood, of
        the violence the humans did before the flood, of the oppressive tower building in Babylon,
        of the city of Sodom, and of the poor foreigner, Hagar. God is a god who hears.
