      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        Solomon introduces a deeply troubled and yet theologically complex character to the canvas
        of the Davidic storyline. Far from the deeply personal character arcs of Samuel, Saul,
        David, and Absalom with all their nuance and inner turmoil, Solomon hardly seems to
        demonstrate distinct characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike those previous characters, it seems as though the write of 1 Kings wants you to
        ponder Solomon's character in light of the many hyperlinks it lays out throughout his story.
        Was he a good king? Was he a bad king? And how does his goodness or badness work out when he
        ultimately becomes the first fulfillment of God's promise from 2 Samuel 7.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few clues to pay attention to throughout today and tomorrow's reading: pay attention to
        all the references to Egypt, to Solomon's accumulation of goods, and how he employs labor.
        And especially, pay attention to how many of these elements hyperlink back to Deuteronomy 17
        and Exodus 5.
