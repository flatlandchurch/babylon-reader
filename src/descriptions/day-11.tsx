        <strong>
          Content warning: Today's reading contains a depiction of extreme sexual violence in Judges
          19. Feel free to skip ahead to Judges 20 should this be too upsetting.

        Yesterday, we watched a Levite increase his own wealth by becoming a priest in a personal
        temple which led to the destruction of an innocent city. Recall that the Levites were tasked
        with being the chosen family within the Israelites uniquely called to be priests to Israel
        so that Israel could be priests to the nations. The Levites were also tasked with teaching
        the people the instructions of God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every time we see a Levite in a story, we should stop and ask ourselves exactly how is the
        blessing God promised to Israel being mediated both to Israel and to the whole world.
        Unfortunately, most of the time, we see anything but a blessing when this hyperlink appears.
        Rather, we see the steady descent of God's people into the ways of Babylon.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of today's reading, we'll see Israel having sunk to a lower low than even Sodom
        and Gomorrah from Genesis 19. Israel has become like Babylon, and it's only hope is a
        prophet-priest-king in the model of Deuteronomy 17.
