      <h2>Intro</h2>
      <p>
        Yesterday we began the story of Abram, and watched he and his wife, Sarai, follow their own
        way into Egypt. God provides for them, but not without harming the household of Pharaoh
        because of Abram's self-serving attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        But God is still committed to this human couple who he promises will become a family and
        then a nation. God promises Abram land, offspring, and that through Abram will come a
        blessing for the whole world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now it's important that whenever we see the word "blessing" we think back to the blessing
        God gives to the humans in Genesis 1:28. Much like God's blessing of the humans, God's
        blessing to Abram is to increase in number and to have dominion over a certain plot of land.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the third blessing God makes to Abram, is meant to be a fulfillment of the
        "proto-Gospel" of Genesis 3:15. Through the genealogy of Abram will come the seed of the
        woman who will crush the head of the serpent and restore the world to the project of
        goodness in the garden.
